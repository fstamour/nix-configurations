## Description

This is the configuration file used for my desktop computer.
It is the first configuration I made with nixos, so its way not perfect.

## What special?

 * Legacy boot-loader (grub)
 * Uses a private "local-configuration.nix" file.
 * Allow unFree software in order to use NVidia's proprietary drivers.
 * Virtualisation enabled.
