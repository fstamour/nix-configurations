# Nix Configurations

 * The folder `dev-env` contains .nix files used to setup development environment, they are supposed to be very generic (e.g. not polyglot).
 * The folder `examples` contains examples of what can be done with nix.
 * The folder `machines` contains configurations files that I used for different (personal) computers.
 * The folder `user-config` contains user configurations.
